# How to Contribute
Thanks for your interest in contributing to CUCM Configuration tracker tool! Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review. Following these guidelines helps to communicate 
that you respect the time of the contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect, we endeavor to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will close any lingering issues or pull requests after 60 days of inactivity.

Please note that all of your interactions in the project are subject to our Code of Conduct. This includes creation of issues or pull requests, commenting on issues or pull requests, and extends to all interactions in any real-time space e.g., Slack, Discord, etc.

## Reporting Issues

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a test case.


## Sending Pull Requests
Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as we follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next major version release.

## Other Ways to Contribute
We welcome anyone that wants to contribute to this project to triage and reply to open issues to help troubleshoot and fix existing bugs. Here is what you can do:

Help ensure that existing issues follows the recommendations from the Reporting Issues section, providing feedback to the issue's author on what might be missing.
Write a test, or add a missing test case to an existing test.
